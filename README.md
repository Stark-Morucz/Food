BME Laboratory project
AIMS:
Get knowledge about:
  KOTLIN
  SQLITE
  FIREBASE
  
 This application was created for a unviersity project.
 Coded with Kotlin and users authenticated through Firebase.
 Users' data saved on the device through SQLite.
 Application tries to follow Mater Design. (There are some exceptions, where I use a view, I learned thorugh a subject at the university and found nice.)
 
 The application is useful for planning different meals for a week or for training plans. You can add your own meals and edit the protein, fat, carbohydrate and calorie quantitiy of each food.
 
This project was made to study about the basics of Kotlin in order to prepare for my thesis on the same language (Kotlin).
